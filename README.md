# NeST-VNN: A visible neural network model for drug response prediction using a data-driven map of cancer protein assemblies
NeST-VNN is an interpretable neural network-based model that predicts
cell response to a drug. The first explainable data-driven method 
for cancer therapeutic response prediction, in which cell structure 
is modeled using a hierarchical map of tumor cell systems, called NeST (https://idekerlab.ucsd.edu/nest/).
This framework integrates information across multiple levels of 
cancer cell biology to understand drug response, and can serve 
to identify and explain biomarkers for clinical application.

NeST-VNN characterizes each cell line using its genotype;
the feature vector for each cell is a binary vector representing
mutational status and copy number variations of the genes 
used in clinical panels like Foundation Medicine (n=718).

NeST-VNN source code has been derived from DrugCell (https://github.com/idekerlab/DrugCell).

# Train a new  model
To train a new model using a custom data set, first make sure that you have
a proper virtual environment set up. Also make sure that you have all the required files
to run the training scripts:

1. Cell feature files:
    * _gene2ind.txt_: make sure you are using _gene2ind.txt_ file provided in this repository.
    * _cell2ind.txt_: a tab-delimited file where the 1st column is index of cells 
        and the 2nd column is the name of cells (genotypes).
    * _cell2mutation.txt_: a comma-delimited file where each row has 718 binary values
         indicating each gene is mutated (1) or not (0).
    The column index of each gene should match with those in _gene2ind.txt_ file. 
    The line number should match with the indices of cells in _cell2ind.txt_ file.
    * _cell2cndeletion.txt_: a comma-delimited file where each row has 718 binary values
         indicating copy number deletion (1) (0 for not).
    * _cell2amplification.txt_: a comma-delimited file where each row has 718 binary values
         indicating copy number amplification (1) (0 for not).

2. Training data file: _training_data.txt_
    * A tab-delimited file containing all data points that you want to use to train the model.
    The 1st column is identification of cells (genotypes), the 2nd column is a placeholder 
    for drug id and the 3rd column is an observed drug response in a floating point number.

3. Ontology (hierarchy) file: _ontology.txt_
    * A tab-delimited file that contains the ontology (hierarchy) that defines the structure of a branch
    of a NeST-VNN model that encodes the genotypes. The first column is always a term (subsystem or pathway),
    and the second column is a term or a gene.
    The third column should be set to "default" when the line represents a link between terms,
    "gene" when the line represents an annotation link between a term and a gene.
    The following is an example describing a sample hierarchy.

        ![](https://github.com/idekerlab/DrugCell/blob/master/misc/drugcell_ont_image_sample.png)

    ```
     GO:0045834	GO:0045923	default
     GO:0045834	GO:0043552	default
     GO:0045923	AKT2	gene
     GO:0045923	IL1B	gene
     GO:0043552	PIK3R4	gene
     GO:0043552	SRC	gene
     GO:0043552	FLT1	gene       
    ```

     * Example of the file (_ontology.txt_) is provided in _sample_ folder.


There are several optional parameters that you can provide in addition to the input files:

1. _-modeldir_: a name of directory where you want to store the trained models. The default
is set to "MODEL" in the current working directory.

2. _-genotype_hiddens_: a number of neurons to assign each subsystem in the hierarchy.
The default is set to 6.

3. _-epoch_: the number of epoch to run during the training phase. The default is set to 300.

4. _-batchsize_: the size of each batch to process at a time. The deafult is set to 5000.
You may increase this number to speed up the training process within the memory capacity
of your GPU server.

5. _lr_: Learning rate. Default is set 0.001.

6. _wd_: Weight decay. Default is set 0.001.

7. _-cuda_: the ID of GPU unit that you want to use for the model training. The default setting
is to use GPU 0.

* All the parameters are mentioned in the src/train.py file.

Finally, to train a NeST-VNN model, execute a command line similar to the example provided in
_sample/train.sh_:

```
python -u train.py  -onto ontology.txt
                    -gene2id gene2ind.txt
                    -cell2id cell2ind.txt
                    -genotype cell2mutation.txt

                    -cn_amplifications cell2amplification.txt
                    -train train.txt
                    -modeldir sample/model
                    -genotype_hiddens 6
                    -epoch 100
                    -batchsize 64
                    -cuda 0
                    -lr 0.0005
                    -wd 0.0005
```
